# Responsive Landing Page

This project demonstrates how to create an interactive navigation menu that enhances user experience through dynamic styling. The menu changes color or style when a user scrolls the page or hovers over a menu item. Additionally, the navigation menu is fixed in position, ensuring it remains visible as the user navigates through the content.



## Features

- Fixed Position: The navigation menu remains at the top of the viewport, visible at all times as you scroll through the page.
- Scroll-Based Interaction: The menu changes color or style based on the user's scroll position, providing visual feedback that enhances navigation.
- Hover Effects: Each menu item changes color or style when hovered over, offering an interactive experience to the user.
- Responsive Design: The navigation menu is designed to be fully responsive, adapting to various screen sizes and devices.


## Technologies Used
- HTML5: For structuring the content and layout of the web page.
- CSS3: For styling the menu, including transitions, animations, and responsive design.


## Usage/Examples

The project is designed to be easy to use and customize:

- HTML Structure: The navigation menu is defined in the <header> section, with menu items listed within a <nav> element. Each menu item is an <a> tag linking to different sections of the page.

- CSS Styling: Custom styles are applied to the navigation menu for its fixed positioning, hover effects, and scroll-based changes. The CSS includes media queries to ensure the menu is responsive.
